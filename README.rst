FAQ

Q1: Does 'dosca' have validation capabilities?

A1: No, it's not. If you want validate your config, use library designed for this task.
`Contract <https://github.com/barbuza/contract>`_, `Procrustes <https://github.com/Deepwalker/procrustes>`_ or, perhaps, Damn Simple Validation Library?



Q2: Does it support interpolation or some complex types?
